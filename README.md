# Covid-19-ICU-Prediction-Analysis
This project explains the implementation of exploratory data analysis and machine learning model development for predicting ICU admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim is to analyze a dataset obtained from the "Kaggle Sirio Libanes ICU Prediction" dataset and develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques.
Steps taken to do the analysis includes: data description, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, data cleaning and transformation, data visualization, data preprocessing, feature selection, and model building and evaluation and performance analysis.
The dataset used in the project comprises information on 1925 patients admitted to the ICU, including demographic details, comorbidities, laboratory test results, and vital signs. The target variable indicates whether a patient was admitted to the ICU or not.
During the data preprocessing phase, missing values are handled by either imputation or deletion, and continuous features are normalized using z-score normalization. Exploratory data analysis is conducted to gain insights into the dataset, including the distribution of the target variable, demographic and clinical features, and the influence of comorbidities on ICU admissions.
Data cleaning and transformation involve converting non-numeric columns to float using one-hot encoding and subdividing certain columns into sub-columns to represent specific percentiles or categories.
Data visualization techniques, such as bar plots, box plots, count plots, and scatter plots, are used to visualize relationships between different features in the dataset and understand patterns and correlations.
The research paper also discusses the importance of handling missing values effectively during data preprocessing and explains the steps taken to preprocess the data.
Feature selection is performed using the ExtraTreesRegressor algorithm to determine the importance of features in predicting the ICU target variable. The resulting feature importance rankings are visualized to identify the most influential features for predicting ICU admissions.
The model building and evaluation section demonstrates the use of the train_test_split function from scikit-learn to split the dataset into training and testing sets. This allows for training machine learning models on the training data and evaluating their performance on unseen testing data.
Overall, the research paper provides a comprehensive overview of the data analysis and machine learning process for predicting ICU admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic. It covers various steps, techniques, and visualizations used to analyze the dataset, preprocess the data, select relevant features, and build and evaluate predictive models.
